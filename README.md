Topic: House Price Prediction Based On Random Forest

Methodology:
Our group plans to introduce Random Forest as a regression technique. In our demonstration we will explore how various attributes affect the price of houses. Graphic explanation would mainly be used with minimal mathematical notations.

We will comprehensively explain these pointers during our lesson:
-Importance 
-Decision Trees
-What are Random Forests?
-Bagging/ Dividing feature space
-Pruning the tree (overfitting prevention)
-Kernel Induced Random Forest
-Out of bag error (performance metric)
-Variable Importance
-Applications (implementation details)
-Advantages & Disadvantages

Demo:
Our live demo would be running a regression using random forest. The input data would be the sales price and numerous housing properties, which are used to train and test the regression model. The final regression model would be take any data to predict the corresponding housing price.
